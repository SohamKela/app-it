description: >-
  Turn a local project or hosted Claude Artifact URL into a macOS
  Dock-launchable .app. Use when the user wants a clickable Dock app, local app
  package, icon, App It install, Artifact wrapper, or repeatable desktop
  launcher. Defaults to native Swift WebKit, shipped templates, and
  verification of build, launch, ports, quit, warm relaunch, and cleanup.

# app-it - Make a local project or hosted Artifact launchable from the Dock

App It installs local projects under `~/Applications/App It/` as clickable
macOS apps: click opens, window close stays warm, Cmd+Q cleans up.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Run `templates/inspect.sh` first and read the output before editing.
2. Trust disk over docs. Verify project type from `package.json`, config files,
   and actual scripts when docs disagree.
3. Decide for the user when the default is defensible. Ask only before a
   destructive or genuinely ambiguous choice.
4. Copy the shipped templates into the target project and customize through
   `scripts/app-it.config.json`. Do not re-derive launcher patterns.
5. Keep App It local and reversible. No Electron/Tauri migration unless the
   project already has one or Strategy A cannot satisfy the requirement.
6. Verify the installed app path, runtime port truth, warm relaunch, Cmd+Q
   cleanup, and report honestly when GUI-only checks need a human.
7. Keep Claude Artifact auth with Claude. If an Artifact uses hosted runtime
   APIs (`window.claude`, `window.storage`, MCP prompts, or Claude-provided
   auth), package a published/shared `claude.ai` URL. Never copy sessions,
   cookies, API keys, or another user's Claude auth into a local bundle.

## Reference Map

Open these only when the inspection or chosen path needs them:

- `references/project-inspection.md` - inspect output, app naming, bundle IDs,
  multi-app signals, and framework recipes.
- `references/strategies.md` - A1 native, Chrome fallback, A2 static, A3
  multi-server, A4 CLI, existing Electron/Tauri/NW.js, and Strategy D.
- `references/ports-and-worktrees.md` - worktrees, runtime port truth,
  hardcoded/env ports, and framework port cheat sheet.
- `references/generated-files.md` - allowed files, templates, config JSON,
  placeholders, scripts, and generated docs.
- `references/assets-and-icons.md` - icon discovery, rejection, preview,
  placeholders, and replacement.
- `references/fsa-and-chromium.md` - File System Access, polyfill, and
  Chromium-only routing.
- `references/verification.md` - build/install/runtime checks, smoke checks,
  human/deferred buckets, and cleanup semantics.
- `references/troubleshooting.md` - Gatekeeper/iCloud rescue, stale wrappers,
  `desktop:doctor`, and anti-patterns.
- `references/report-template.md` - exact final report format. Use it for the
  chat reply and `docs/desktop-launcher.app-it-report.md`.

## Templates

Copy templates from `templates/`; do not rewrite them. They encode the Mach-O
entrypoint, NFC/NFD-safe matching, daemon servers, two-stage cleanup, runtime
port fallback, descendant reattach, Finder/Dock `PATH`, menu shortcuts, and
doctor checks. See `references/generated-files.md` for the roster.

## Workflow

### 1. Inspect

Run the bundled inspector from the target project root:

```bash
/path/to/plugins/app-it/skills/app-it/templates/inspect.sh
```

Use its output for worktree status, project type, scripts, hardcoded ports,
multi-app/cohabiting-server signals, FSA, port collisions, toolchains, runtime
paths, and assets.

Read `references/project-inspection.md` before resolving app count, names,
bundle IDs, existing desktop configs, or project type. Read
`references/ports-and-worktrees.md` for worktrees, hardcoded ports, proxy
targets, or cohabiting frontend/backend servers.

### 2. Decide

For each user-facing app, choose one strategy:

```text
Existing Electron/Tauri/NW.js config?
  yes -> Strategy B
  no  -> native desktop requirements beyond web shell?
           yes -> Strategy D
           no  -> FSA real-I/O or Chromium-only API?
                    yes -> A1 Chrome fallback
                    no  -> static built bundle, no server?
                             yes -> A2
                             no  -> cohabiting frontend + backend?
                                      yes -> A3
                                      no  -> A1 native WebKit (default)
```

Default to A1 native WebKit. Use Chrome fallback for real File System Access or
other Chromium-only APIs. Use Electron/Tauri/NW.js only when the project already
owns that path. Read `references/strategies.md` before anything beyond simple
A1.

### 3. Build

Touch as few target-project files as possible. Read `generated-files` for the
allowed surface/config, `assets-and-icons` before icon work, and
`fsa-and-chromium` before FSA polyfill or Chrome fallback.

### 4. Verify

Verification is mandatory. Read `references/verification.md` and run applicable
programmatic checks:

Check executable shape, plist/icon validity, installed-path open, runtime port,
HTTP response, process and LaunchServices identity, Cmd+Q cleanup via Apple
Event, red-X warm state, and warm relaunch. Use `desktop:verify` for the
headless loop and `desktop:doctor` for ownership/template drift. Prefer their
`--json` modes for automation. `desktop:verify` uses `APP_IT_SMOKE=1` and marks
GUI-only checks manual unless a visible app window is actually driven.

Never claim GUI-only checks passed unless you can actually see them. Put window
content, Dock icon identity, autoplay, and FSA reconnect into the human bucket
when the environment cannot verify them.

### 5. Report

End with the `references/report-template.md` report inline and in
`docs/desktop-launcher.app-it-report.md`: strategy, changed files, icon source,
build/install/quit commands, installed paths, verification, Dock Stack note,
limitations, and decisions.

Stage new files with `git add` only when that is the repository's local
convention or the user asked for staging. Do not commit unless asked.

## Quick Defaults

- Install destination: `~/Applications/App It/`.
- Bundle ID prefix: `com.user.<slug>`, unless the project has a real domain.
- Preferred single-server ports: Next/CRA `3000`, Vite/SvelteKit `5173`, Astro
  `4321`, Flask/FastAPI project default.
- Port mode: keep `port_mode: "fallback"` unless browser storage, OAuth
  callbacks, or project config must stay on exactly one localhost origin. Use
  `port_mode: "fixed"` for that case; a busy preferred port is then a clear
  launch failure, not an upward scan.
- Framework recipes live in `project-inspection` and `ports-and-worktrees`.
  Translate examples to the package manager present.
- Next: use the direct binary when a script hardcodes flags, wraps `next dev`,
  or needs host/port flags:
  `pnpm exec next dev --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port "$PORT"` (translate `pnpm`
  to npm/yarn/bun as needed). Plain scripts that only run `next dev` are OK
  when they already honor `PORT`.
- Vite/SvelteKit command:
  `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port "$PORT" --strictPort`.
- Astro command: `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port "$PORT"`.
- Chrome fallback shutdown: document `desktop:quit` as primary cleanup because
  Chrome close/Cmd+Q do not map to the Swift wrapper lifecycle.

## Stop Signs

Stop and explain clearly if the project needs blocking setup/auth, the start
command cannot honor the launcher port, a smoke test proves the project is
broken before the launcher, or the environment is hostile to verification.

## What Not To Do

- Do not make App It explicit-only.
- Do not default to Chrome for vanilla web apps.
- Do not attach to an arbitrary externally running server.
- Do not use `kill -TERM` on the wrapper to test Cmd+Q.
- Do not hardcode `com.$(id -un).*` bundle IDs.
- Do not derive `PROJECT_ROOT` from the installed app path.
- Do not remove PATH augmentation, runtime port fallback, daemon-mode warm
  relaunch, two-stage cleanup, native menu shortcuts, or doctor diagnostics.
